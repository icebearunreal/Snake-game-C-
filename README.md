# Snake-game-C-
Snake game (C): 
This is a C game. 
## What's it's gimmick???
- It runs entirely in terminal
- Uses less than 20 kilobytes of storage space (With extra files that arent even in this repo)
- uses like 2 touches from memory (rea)
- Is cool
## What can YOU improve???
- Add loops (Bc im busy with other projects so be the first to add the loop mechanism where if you cross a border, you 'loop' to the opposite border iykwim)
- Maybe make a GUI version put it in gui folder (make the folder too)
- Add soundFX
- help me with my other projects
